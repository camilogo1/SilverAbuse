            <h1>About Silver Abuse</h1>
            <p>Silver Abuse was one of the original punk bands in Chicago, 
            forming in 1977. There were various versions of Silver Abuse, 
            but the original version starred lifetime member Bill Meehan, 
            along with Santiago Durango and Camilo Gonzalez, 
            early members of Naked Raygun.</p>
            <p>Silver Abuse was featured prominently in the documentary 
            &quot;You Weren’t There&quot; which tells the story of Chicago punk and 
            hardcore from &#39;77 to &#39;84. From Miles Raymer&#39;s review in the 
            Chicago Reader-&quot;In the late 70s just a few bands made up the scene, 
            but among them were Silver Abuse, who wore tinfoil and played 
            aggressively dissonant guitar skree… &quot;Silver Abuse, I have some demos 
            that they did in like ’82 that sound completely relevant today,&quot;</p>
            <p>Losurdo says. &quot;It’s a little more no wave, and they have girl vocals 
            and really off-kilter rhythms and sax.&quot; —evensi</p>
