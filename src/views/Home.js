            <h1>About Silver Abuse</h1>
            <p>Silver Abuse is one of the original punk bands in Chicago, 
            formed in 1977 and still playing today.</p>
            <p>Silver Abuse is featured prominently in the documentary 
            &quot;You Weren’t There&quot; which tells the story of Chicago punk and 
            hardcore from &#39;77 to &#39;84. From Miles Raymer&#39;s review in the 
            Chicago Reader- &quot;In the late 70s just a few bands made up the scene, 
            but among them were Silver Abuse, who wore tinfoil and played 
            aggressively dissonant guitar skree… &quot;Silver Abuse, I have some demos 
            that they did in like ’82 that sound completely relevant today,&quot;</p>
            <p>Losurdo says. &quot;It’s a little more no wave, and they have girl vocals 
            and really off-kilter rhythms and sax.&quot; —evensi</p>

            <p>Silver Abuse continue to record and play to this day. They've incorporated current sensiblities into their odd and cracked worldview. Their current sound is still recognizable as Punk by virtue of its furious energy, but also draws upon Krautrock and early New York Rock to acheive a modern throb.</p>
